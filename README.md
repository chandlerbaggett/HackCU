Python is required to run this program.

Insert into wineCharacteristics.txt characteristics of a wine variety separated by a space. Run the program by typing "python classify.py".

For example:

	Your wineCharacteristics file might look like the following:

		light tannins cabbage wet leaves strawberry raspberry cherry mushroom meaty

	Running python classify.py would return the following:

		Pinot Noir

The program was created by running a Naive Bayes machine learning classification algorithm on a dataset containing wine varieties and their respective descriptions. The dataset was found on Kaggle.

Be patient as training occurs every time the program is ran
